                    This dojo is a gathering of Aikido students practicing together and learning
                    from each other.  By sharing our previous experiences, styles, and techniques, all students enjoy a wider array of knowledge of Aikido.  Philosophically, we don't have instructors; we have students who share.

Mililani Aikido Founder - Takaji Ishida Sensei (1906-1996)

Takaji Ishida Sensei was born in Niigata, Japan, in  October,1906.  He worked for the then Waialua Agricultural  Company in 1923 and retired from the Waialua Sugar Company in 1971. He died on 9 August, 1996, at the age of 89.

During his younger days, Ishida Sensei exhibited great interest in the martial arts.  He practiced sumo with former Hawaii Governor George Ariyoshi’s father.  At age 18, he began training in judo.  In 1944, he overcame tremendous obstacles to acquire permission to reorganize judo classes in Hawaii which were banned during the war years.  About 60 judo students trained under him at the Waialua Hongwanji Mission social hall.  He later expanded judo classes in Kahuku, Wahiawa, Mililani, and Kona.

Then, in the early 1950’s, Ishida Sensei witnessed an Aikido demonstration by Koichi Tohei Sensei and was smitten with Aikido.  He had the honor to have studied with Morihei Ueshiba O-Sensei in Japan and Hawaii, and had faithfully shared O-Sensei’s teaching with his students.  Through his leadership and tenaciousness, he overcame tremendous obstacles  and worked tirelessly to establish and stabilize Aikido in Hawaii.  To this end, Ishida Sensei served as the 2nd Vice President of the Hawaii Aiki Kwai. He personally taught Aikido throughout Honolulu and occasionally on the neighbor islands.  Through the Central Pacific Aikido Association which he established, Ishida Sensei opened Aikido dojos at various locations including Waialua, Wahiawa, Waipahu, and Mililani.  For these and his many other achievements and contributions, Ishida Sensei was awarded his 8th Dan rank in Aikido on 9 January 1994.  
His selfless devotion to Aikido serves as an inspiration to all those who follow in his footsteps.

 If it were not for him, we would not have had Aikido dojos at Waialua, Wahiawa, Waipahu, or Mililani.  There would not be a Central Pacific Aikido Association, and most importantly, there would not be the hundreds of students who remembered Ishida Sensei fondly.  While many of his students continue to train actively, many more inactive students continue to practice the values, morals, and ethics of his Aikido instruction in their daily lives.  I am fortunate to be among those who had the benefit of his instruction.  I was the last to receive a Shodan promotion from him.  With that promotion came a self-inflicted obligation to help carry on Ishida Sensei’s lifetime work to share Aikido with everyone.  It is astonishing to find how many of Ishida Sensei’s former students have the same self-infliction.
